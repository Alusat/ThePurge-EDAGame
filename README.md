# ThePurge-EDAGame

Game from the EDA subject. Consists of creating an AI bot that competes with other players making use of graph algorithms such as BFS.
See more on the rules.pdf

The bot that I created is called AIGyroZeppeli.cc (generates HADES player)

## How to execute a game

Build:
```bash
make
```

Run (more info with `./Game --help`):
```bash
./Game HADES Demo Demo Demo -s 30 -i default.cnf -o default.res
```

The rounds and results will be printed and a `*.out` file will be generated.

To see the representation of that game, open `/Viewer/Viewer.html` and load the `.out` file.
